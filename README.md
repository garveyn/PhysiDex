# PhysiDex
A deck tracker for all the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. Created as part of a Champlain College Capstone project for Computer Science & Innovation. 

## Design

The implemented architecture has three main sections: Search, My Binder, and the Deck Manager. Sections are accessed using a navigation drawer, and are built branching off of a simple home page. Each of the main sections has multiple pages. These pages follow a general design of showing broader information and then showing more detail further on in the design. For example, when a user goes to My Binder on the navigation drawer, they will be brought to a page that shows previews of a few possible views of their collection. Clicking on one of those previews will show all cards in that specific order, and from there, clicking on one card will show detail on that specific card.
